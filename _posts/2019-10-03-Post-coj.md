title: Call of Juarez Bound in Blood Golden Weapons 
---

Unlock Golden (Superb) Weapons in Multiplayer

    Step 1: Download and install any Hex Editor if you don't have one. I recommend HxD.
    Step 2: Open your profile from Documents Call of Juarez - Bound in BloodOutProfiles[ProfileName].pro with the hex editor you downloaded.
    Step 3: Search for hex code "53 69 6C 76 65 72 52 65 77 61 72 64 41 6E 6E 6F 75 6E 63 65 64"
    Step 4: After the code you found (displayed as SilverRewardAnnounced), there will be much 00 00 00 displayed as "...." Go to the second 00 (second point) and make it 01 instead of 00.
    Step 5: You will find GoldenRewardAnnounced just right under it. Repeat step 4 on GoldenRewardAnnounced.
    Step 6: Save and enjoy your new golden weapons!
